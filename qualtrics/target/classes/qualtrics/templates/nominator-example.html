  <p style="font-size: 14px">Disclaimer: this project was developed by SUS to act as a way of facilitating nominations during a remote election. It is completely open-source; you may view the source-code <a href="https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/qualtrics-lambda">here</a>. No data is held by the program, as it only relays data from Qualtrics. The project itself is hosted on Canadian servers.</p>
